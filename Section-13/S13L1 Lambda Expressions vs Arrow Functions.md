# Lambda Expressions vs Arrow Functions

> Python lambdas are deliberately limited single-expression functions, while TypeScript arrow functions are fully-featured function alternatives.

## Introduction

- As a TypeScript developer, you're likely comfortable using arrow functions for creating concise inline functions
- In Python, lambda expressions serve a similar purpose but with important restrictions
- You'll learn: lambda syntax, critical limitations compared to arrow functions, and when to use (or avoid) lambdas
- By understanding Python's approach to anonymous functions, you'll write more idiomatic and effective Python code

## Main Content

### A. Concept Translation

> **Key Insight**: Python lambdas are designed to be limited by intention - they're meant for simple operations only, not as a complete alternative to regular functions.

**Basic syntax comparison:**

```typescript
// TypeScript arrow functions
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const isEven = (x) => x % 2 === 0;
```

```python
# Python lambda expressions
double = lambda x: x * 2
sum = lambda a, b: a + b
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
```

While the syntax appears similar at first glance, lambdas in Python are deliberately restricted to a single expression. This is fundamentally different from TypeScript arrow functions, which can contain multiple statements, conditionals, and complex logic.

**Key differences:**

- Python lambdas are restricted to a single expression (no multiple statements, no blocks)
- No implicit `this` binding (Python doesn't have the equivalent concept)
- Lambdas cannot contain assignments or statements like `if/else`
- The lambda's body is automatically returned (similar to arrow functions)

### B. Python Context

Python's approach to anonymous functions is shaped by its design philosophy. Where JavaScript embraces functional programming patterns more fully, Python takes a more cautious approach:

- Python's creator (Guido van Rossum) has been historically skeptical of some functional programming features
- Python prioritizes readability over terseness ("Explicit is better than implicit")
- Regular named functions are preferred for most use cases in Python

**Common lambda use cases:**

```python
# Sorting with a custom key function
users = [{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}]
sorted_users = sorted(users, key=lambda user: user['age'])

# Quick filtering
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

# Simple mapping operations
doubled = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
```

> **Key Insight**: Python often provides alternatives to lambda-based functional approaches through list comprehensions and generator expressions, which are generally considered more "Pythonic."

### C. Practical Implementation

#### Real-World Example: Processing a Collection

**TypeScript approach:**

```typescript
// Arrow functions with array methods
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 32, active: true },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 24, active: false },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 45, active: true }
];

// Chain operations with arrow functions
const activeUserNames = users
  .filter(user => user.active)
  .map(user => user.name)
  .sort();

// Multi-line arrow function with logic
const categorizeUsers = users.map(user => {
  if (user.age < 30) return { ...user, category: 'young' };
  else if (user.age < 50) return { ...user, category: 'middle-aged' };
  else return { ...user, category: 'senior' };
});
```

**Python approach:**

```python
users = [
  {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 32, 'active': True},
  {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 24, 'active': False},
  {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 45, 'active': True}
]

# Lambda approach (less common)
active_users = list(filter(lambda user: user['active'], users))
active_user_names = list(map(lambda user: user['name'], active_users))
active_user_names.sort()

# More Pythonic approach with list comprehensions
active_user_names = sorted([user['name'] for user in users if user['active']])

# Complex logic requires a named function, not lambda
def categorize_user(user):
    if user['age'] < 30:
        return {**user, 'category': 'young'}
    elif user['age'] < 50:
        return {**user, 'category': 'middle-aged'}
    else:
        return {**user, 'category': 'senior'}

categorized_users = [categorize_user(user) for user in users]
```

**Complete working example:**

```python
def process_user_data(users):
    # Get sorted names of active users
    active_user_names = sorted([user['name'] for user in users if user['active']])
    
    # Get average age of all users
    total_age = sum(user['age'] for user in users)
    average_age = total_age / len(users) if users else 0
    
    # Group users by activity status (using dictionary comprehension)
    users_by_status = {
        'active': [user for user in users if user['active']],
        'inactive': [user for user in users if not user['active']]
    }
    
    return {
        'active_user_names': active_user_names,
        'average_age': average_age,
        'users_by_status': users_by_status
    }

# Usage example
users = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 32, 'active': True},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 24, 'active': False},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 45, 'active': True}
]

result = process_user_data(users)
print(f"Active users: {result['active_user_names']}")
print(f"Average age: {result['average_age']:.1f}")
print(f"Active users count: {len(result['users_by_status']['active'])}")
```

> [!warning] Common Pitfall TypeScript developers often try to write complex multi-line lambda functions in Python, but this will fail. Remember that Python lambdas can only contain a single expression, not statements or blocks.

```python
# THIS WILL NOT WORK:
process = lambda x: 
    if x > 0:
        return x * 2
    else:
        return 0
        
# Instead, write a proper function:
def process(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x * 2
    else:
        return 0
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use lambdas only for very simple operations (a single expression)
- For anything requiring logic, conditionals, or multiple operations, use a proper named function
- Consider list/dict comprehensions as a more readable alternative to lambda with map/filter
- Use lambdas primarily as "throwaway" functions passed to higher-order functions

## Summary

- Python lambdas are deliberately limited single-expression anonymous functions, unlike TypeScript's fully-featured arrow functions
- While both provide concise syntax for simple operations, Python's philosophy prefers explicit named functions for anything complex
- For collection processing, Python offers more idiomatic alternatives like list comprehensions instead of chained lambda operations
- When working with higher-order functions like `sorted()`, `filter()`, and `map()`, lambdas can be useful for simple key or predicate functions
